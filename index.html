              <p>There is much work to be done before the murals make it to the walls of GMU. Behind the scenes, we have set up a club called the Mural Brigade which you can find and join <a href = "https://getconnected.gmu.edu/organization/muralbrigade">here</a></p>
              <p>The Mural Brigade aims to keep everyone on the team organized as we move forward applying for grants, creating and implementing marketing plans, collecting monetary support, and turning the dream of a fresh, new campus into a reality.
                As part of the Mason Family, we would like to ask if you would support this project and be a part of major improvements for the university and the community as a whole.</p>
              <p> Made up of students and faculty of various backgrounds, we currently have meetings 4 days a week with a “come as you please” system.</p>
              <p>
                Can’t make it for the whole meeting? No problem
              </p>
              <p>
                Need to leave early for class? Go ahead.
              </p>
              <p>
                We understand that students have busy schedules but by working together, we will be able to accomplish great things as we come closer to the completion of the project!

              <p>Murals are an amazing form of art that not only enrich their surroundings with vibrant color and imagery,
                but also bring art to the public sphere for the community to enjoy, reflect on, and interperate together.
              </p>
              <p>The average mural costs roughly $21 per square foot with many other factors affecting the final price.  We’ve estimated that each of the #MuralsAtMason will total to around $4,000 and as such, we look to YOU for support.
                As part of the Mason Family, we would like to ask if you would support this project and be a part of major improvements for the university and the community as a whole.
